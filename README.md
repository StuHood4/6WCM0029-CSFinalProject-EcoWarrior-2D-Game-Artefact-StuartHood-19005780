"'Eco-Warrior' - A 2D Game with Elements of Procedural Generation" - By Stuart Hood 19005780

This is the artefact for the final project submission. 

The ZIP file unpacks into the project folder which is approximately 3.64 MB in size. 

Godot version 4.3 or higher is required to open and run the project.

The Godot engine can be obtained from the Godot engine website: https://godotengine.org/. It is completely free and is very lightweight, only occupying around 300MB of disk space.

To access the project in Godot:
  1. Open the Godot Project Manager (it's the first screen that opens when you start Godot)
  2. Press the 'Import' button in the top left hand corner of the project manager.
  3. Select the unzipped projected folder.
  4. To view the project in the editor environment, click on the project and click the 'Edit' button.
  5. To run the game, click the 'Run' button. The game can be run from inside the editor either by pressing 'F5' or clicking the run button in the top left hand corner of the editor.

The bottom left hand panel in the editor is the File System Manager. All of the contents of the project can be browsed and opened from there.

At the top of editor, you can view any opened scenes in the '2D' view, and any open scripts in the 'Script' view. The other views are irrelevant.

If you do not wish to do any of this, you can still view all of the project files in the unzipped folder.
